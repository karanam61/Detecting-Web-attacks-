First let us examine the Ip address :

<img src="./media/media/image2.png" style="width:6.5in;height:2.62014in"
alt="A blue rectangular object with lines AI-generated content may be incorrect." />

This isn’t flagged as malicious by virus total only 1/94 vendors flagged
it . So the reputation isn’t bad but digital ocean is personally known
by me to host dark web servers .

But this doesn’t prove anything so we do log analysis .

<img src="./media/media/image3.png" style="width:6.5in;height:3.56875in"
alt="A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be incorrect." />

<img src="./media/media/image4.png" style="width:6.5in;height:2.72639in"
alt="A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be incorrect." />

<img src="./media/media/image5.png" style="width:6.5in;height:2.91389in"
alt="A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be incorrect." />

Clearly sees the ID PARAMETER BEING EXPLOITED AND HTTP STATUS CODE BEING
200 . IT IS A STRAIGHT UP A RED FLAG .

We need to immediately go to the EDR and check for malicious commands if
there are any . No escalation but the attack has been carried out so the
device should be contained .

<img src="./media/media/image6.png" style="width:6.5in;height:3.10486in"

<img src="./media/media/image7.png" style="width:6.5in;height:2.57847in"
alt="A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be incorrect." />

As expected we’ve completed the play book and the analysis is on point .
