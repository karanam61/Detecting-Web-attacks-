# Detecting Web Attacks

This repo has three folders:
- **Notes/**  
  - **Web-Attacks-Playbook-Part-1.md** → basic web attacks (SQLi, XSS, Command Injection, IDOR, LFI/RFI)
  - **Web-Attacks-Playbook-Part-2.md** → the next set (Open Redirect, Directory Traversal, XXE, Brute Force) with simple, clear explanations
- **Alerts/** → real alerts I worked through
- **Challenges/** → lab scenarios and write-ups

What I use in these notes:
- **SIEM flow:** Monitoring, Log Management, Web Security (WAF/CDN/CSP), Endpoint Security (only if something runs)
- **Framework tags:** **MITRE ATT&CK** technique IDs where it makes sense, and **NIST CSF** phases (Detect → Respond → Recover)
